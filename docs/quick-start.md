# Quick Start

## Launch the TUI

```bash
aoe
```

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | New session |
| `b` | New session from a saved project |
| `p` | Manage saved projects |
| `Enter` | Attach to a session |
| `d` | Delete a session |
| `t` | Toggle Agent / Terminal view |
| `D` | Open the [diff view](guides/diff-view.md) |
| `/` | Search sessions |
| `?` | Full keymap |
| `q` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+b d` | Detach from the tmux session |

## Your first session

Press `n` and fill in the path to your project (or leave `.`), or run `aoe add /path/to/project`. The session appears in the dashboard as **Idle**. Select it and press `Enter` to attach; you are now inside a tmux session running the agent. `Ctrl+b d` detaches back to the TUI. If aoe itself runs inside tmux, attaching switches your client to the agent's session and `Ctrl+b L` switches back.

Press `t` to toggle between the structured view and the paired shell terminal, where you can run builds and git commands without interrupting the agent.

## Projects and groups

A **project** is a saved directory path you register once so you can start sessions from it without retyping. Registering is only a convenience: `n` and `aoe add <path>` work on any path. Add one with `aoe project add /path/to/repo`, or press `p` in the TUI and then `a`. Once a project exists, `b` starts a session from it. See [Multi-repo workspaces](guides/multi-repo-workspaces.md#the-project-registry).

A **group** is unrelated: it is a label you assign to existing sessions to sort them in the sidebar, set by right-clicking a session in the TUI sidebar (**Move to group** / **Remove from group**), from the rename dialog, or with `aoe group move`. Projects are where sessions start; groups are how they are bucketed once they exist. See [the grouping axes](guides/web/dashboard.md#sorting-and-grouping).

## Worktrees

To work on a new branch in its own directory:

```bash
aoe add . -w feat/my-feature -b
```

In the TUI, press `n`, enter a title, and enable Worktree (`Ctrl+P` on the field for an explicit name). Deleting the session offers to clean the worktree up.

Omit `-b` to attach instead: AoE re-uses the worktree for that branch, or checks the branch out into a new one. The TUI and web wizard have an **Attach to existing branch** toggle. Removing a session only cleans up worktrees AoE created. See the [worktrees reference](guides/worktrees.md).

## Resume a Claude conversation

After attaching, run `/resume` in the Claude pane and pick a conversation. AoE captures the session id and persists it, so the next launch reattaches automatically. See [Session resume](guides/session-resume.md).

## Sandboxes and other agents

```bash
aoe add --sandbox .        # run the agent in a container
aoe add -c opencode .      # use a different agent
```

The sandbox mounts your project at `/workspace` and shares authentication through persistent volumes; the TUI has a checkbox for it when a container runtime is available. The agent picker in the new-session dialog lists every detected tool. See the [container sandbox guide](guides/sandbox.md).

## The web dashboard

```bash
aoe serve                  # localhost only
aoe serve --remote         # reachable from your phone over HTTPS
aoe serve --daemon         # run in the background
```

Open the printed URL in any browser for the same sessions, live terminals, and controls, and install it as a PWA for an app-like experience. See the [web dashboard guide](guides/web-dashboard.md).
