# Dashboard & Workspaces

The dashboard is the home screen of the web app: a workspace sidebar on the left, the active session in the main pane, and a top bar with global actions. For running the server and its auth, see the [Web Dashboard overview](../web-dashboard.md).

## Layout

- **Workspace sidebar** lists every session with a live status glyph, grouped by repo. On phones it collapses behind a top-bar toggle.
- **Main pane** shows the selected session: the agent terminal or structured view, with the diff and paired terminal reachable from the top bar.
- **Top bar** carries the command palette, the right-panel picker, and the overflow menu.
- **Home screen** (no session selected) shows a count of running, waiting, and error sessions.

## Creating a session

The **New session** wizard is one screen with these sections:

- **Project**: pick the working directory from the Recent tab (saved projects first, then the directories of recent sessions), browse for one, clone a URL, or start a [scratch session](../scratch-sessions.md) with no path.
- **Session**: set the title, which auto-slugifies into a worktree branch name unless you edit it, or attach an existing branch instead.
- **Agent**: pick the tool and profile, plus per-session knobs (auto-approve, sandbox, command override, extra args and env).
- **Review**: confirm before the session spawns.

Choosing a profile seeds the agent-step defaults; switching profiles after you have edited a field asks first.

A plain New session opens on the project you launched last; pick another from Recent or Browse to change it.

## Command palette

The palette (top-bar button or keyboard shortcut) is a fuzzy launcher for global actions: jump to a session, open settings, start a session, toggle the right panel. Individual settings appear under `Settings`: a writable toggle flips inline with a toast, while read-only servers and settings needing elevation open the settings view instead. The Settings header has its own search box (the TUI settings screen uses `/`) that filters across every tab.

## First-run onboarding

The first time you open the dashboard, a **Choose your theme** card appears; picking one applies it live and saves it to your default profile. After it, an interactive walkthrough highlights the command bar, sidebar, session creation, settings, and, inside a session, the diff panel and composer. Two steps open Settings for you (Worktree and Plugins).

Completing or skipping it records `app_state.has_seen_web_tour` on the server (in `state.toml`, see the [configuration reference](../configuration.md#file-locations)), so it does not relaunch on another device. Replay it from the overflow menu's **Show tutorial**; it does not auto-launch on touch devices. Both the theme card and the tour are skipped in read-only mode.

## Sorting and grouping

By default the sidebar keeps your manual order. Drag a row (press and hold) to move it; that order syncs across browsers via `workspace-ordering.json`. Drag a project or group header to reorder whole groups, which is per-browser and disabled while a filter or a computed sort is active.

The sort picker offers three modes, and drag is available only in the first:

- **Manual** (default).
- **Recent activity**: by the most recent of `last_accessed_at`, `idle_entered_at`, and `created_at` across the workspace's sessions.
- **Attention**: sessions needing a human first, mirroring the TUI. Ranks by status (Waiting, Error, Idle, Unknown, Running, Stopped, transient last), floats sessions the `attention-urgent` hook flagged above non-urgent rows in their tier, favorites first within a rank, then most recent activity.

A grouping toggle next to it cycles **By repo** (default), **By group** (the group set in the TUI by right-clicking a session and choosing **Move to group**, with `aoe group move`, or from the row's **Edit group** menu; ungrouped sessions sit in a bucket at the bottom), and **By repo and group** (repo headers with groups nested inside). Group paths use `/` for hierarchy. Collapse state is tracked per axis, and the sort and grouping choices are per-browser. The Multi-repo and Scratch groups default to the bottom.

## Triage: pin, archive, snooze

Right-click (long-press on touch) a session row:

- **Pin** floats the workspace to the top in every sort mode. Pin is web-only and distinct from the favorite mark.
- **Archive** tears down every tmux session the workspace owns (pass `kill_pane: false` in the API, or `--no-kill` on the CLI, to skip that) and shuts down the structured-view worker, then sinks the row into the collapsible "Snoozed & archived" footer. Daemon restarts skip archived sessions, and sending a message wakes one back into the live list.
- **Snooze** sinks the row for a chosen duration (1h through 1w); it wakes when the timer expires, or early if you send a message.

A session is never pinned and sunk at once, but either transition is one step: pinning a sunk row surfaces it, and archiving or snoozing a pinned row removes the pin. All three entries are hidden in read-only mode.

**Multi-select.** Cmd/Ctrl+click toggles a row in or out of the selection, Shift+click takes the range from the anchor (the last plain-clicked or toggled row) to the clicked row, and a plain click clears the selection and opens that session. With several rows selected, the context menu opens with an **N selected** header and splits actions by the rows they affect (**Pin 3** next to **Unpin 2**). Right-clicking a row outside the selection resets to that row. Bulk actions are best-effort, report a summary, and then clear the selection; **Escape** clears it too. The selection is not saved across reloads.

## Projects

A **Projects** section near the bottom of the sidebar lists saved projects that are not pinned and have no live session; a project with sessions, or a pinned one, renders above as its own header. It is the same registry the wizard's "Saved projects" tab reads. See [Multi-repo workspaces](../multi-repo-workspaces.md#the-project-registry).

Add one with the **+** on the section header (browse or type a path, optionally a name and default base branch, global or profile scope). Clicking a project row starts a session in that repo. **Project settings** (default base branch, worktree-by-default and smart-rename overrides) and **Remove** live in the row's context menu, opened by right-click or long-press; removing deletes every registration for that path. The add / edit / remove controls are hidden in read-only mode.

## Settings and profiles

![The settings view with its tab groups and profile picker](../../assets/web/settings.png)

Settings are grouped into the same tabs as the TUI: **Appearance** (Theme), **Sessions** (session defaults and Structured view), **Environment** (Sandbox, Worktree, Tmux), **Notifications** (Sound and [web push](../../push-notifications.md)), **Web Dashboard** (Terminal, Security, Connected Devices), and **System** (Updates, Logging). The panel is generated from the same settings schema as the TUI, so a field declared once appears on both and they cannot drift. The host environment list is the one config knob the dashboard does not surface.

The profile picker scopes which profile you are editing; global settings apply where a profile does not override a field. The **Profiles** tab (`/settings/profiles`) creates, renames, deletes, and sets the default profile, and its **Edit configuration** buttons deep-link into a tab scoped to that profile. Lifecycle hooks are shown read-only with their source, since hooks run arbitrary shell commands; the same applies to agent-command and environment fields. Creating, deleting, or renaming a profile, and saving global settings, are [step-up](../web-dashboard.md#security) actions.

**Conversation display** (Sessions > Structured view) sets the base font size of the structured-view transcript, separately for mobile and desktop, from 6px to 28px with a 14px default. Prose, headings, lists, tables, and code all scale from it. The mobile value applies on a coarse pointer under 768px, switching live as you resize or rotate. The size is relative to your browser's own font setting, so it stacks with zoom and accessibility preferences. Both values are dashboard preferences stored with your web settings, not agent config, so they follow you across devices and never appear in `config.toml`.

## On mobile

Below the `md` breakpoint the dashboard shows one full-viewport pane. The right-panel button swaps the main pane between **Agent terminal**, **Paired terminal**, and whichever panes the session allows: **Sub agents** in structured-view sessions, **Diff** and **Files** (hidden in CityHall mode), and plugin panes. A back chip returns to the agent terminal. Both terminals stay alive in the background, preserving scrollback and focus.

In a structured-view conversation, a tab at the top right and another just above the composer fold away the top bar and the composer independently, giving the transcript their height back; both tabs stay on screen while collapsed. Leaving the conversation shows the top bar again, since it is the only navigation the other views have.
