//! Carrying a conversation when a restart swaps only which account an agent
//! runs as.
//!
//! `[session.agent_config_dir]` gives one agent several tool names, one per
//! account. Swapping between them changes the agent's config root, so the
//! transcript the outgoing account wrote is invisible to the incoming one and
//! the agent comes up on an empty conversation even though its session id is
//! still valid (#4030). Copying the transcript into the incoming account's
//! root is what makes `--resume <sid>` reach it there.
//!
//! The copy is bounded to swaps that keep the same built-in agent. A swap to a
//! genuinely different agent lands a transcript that agent cannot read, and
//! `Instance::swap_tool` already parks the outgoing ids for it.
