//! Reclaim per-instance agent stores whose session is gone.
//!
//! A sandboxed session mounts `<agent config>/sandbox-v2/<instance id>` as the
//! agent's config directory. Session removal and this orphan pass reclaim
//! only physically certified isolated content, never an unproven original.
//! Old or interrupted-transition data remains in place for explicit recovery.
//!
//! Both paths are deliberately narrow:
//!
//! - A store is an orphan only when its id resolves in no profile of either
//!   build namespace. A registry that cannot be read is never "a profile with
//!   no sessions"; the pass fails and deletes nothing.
//! - A store is removed only when *no* container for its id exists, under any
//!   installed runtime. Not merely "not running": a stopped container can be
//!   started between the check and the removal, and no lock a reclaim can hold
//!   is observed by `docker start`. Requiring absence closes that race by
//!   construction, since a container for an id no session owns cannot be
//!   created either. A runtime that cannot answer reads as "exists", which is
//!   v027's fail-closed posture. Every runtime is asked, not just the one this
//!   build's config names, because ownership spans both build namespaces and
//!   each can name a different one.
//! - A store seeded moments ago is preserved. Container preparation seeds the
//!   store before the session row is inserted (`cli::add` runs `on_create`
//!   hooks, and so `get_container_for_instance`, before it persists), so a
//!   just-created store is briefly indistinguishable from an orphan.
//! - The pass runs under v027's transition lock and refuses while a store move
//!   is mid-flight. It cannot see a half-copied store either way: v027 copies
//!   into `.v027-stage-<id>` and renames, and only a bare 16-hex name is ever a
//!   candidate here, so a store appears to this pass whole or not at all.
//!   Active content journals also defer removal; ownership is durably revoked
//!   before deletion and traversal uses the retained certified directory FD.
//!   Widening that name filter would break the guarantee.
