//! one set of reachability rules. `aoe serve --open` routes through it too, so
//! the server and the TUI cannot disagree about whether a browser is reachable
//! on the same host.
//! When `AOE_OPEN_URL_TO` names a file, the URL is appended to it (one per
//! line) instead of launching a browser; a live-daemon e2e sets it so it can
//! assert the exact URL a chord resolved without spawning a real browser.
//! Unset in normal use, so production behavior is unchanged.
