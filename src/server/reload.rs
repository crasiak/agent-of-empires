//    invoke this helper. They differ in cadence, in what they do BEFORE
//    calling it (tmux scrape lives only in `status_poll_loop`), and in
//    the StatusSource they pass.
// 2. `merge_runtime_fields` is mandatory per-id. Skipping it wipes the
//    #[serde(skip)] runtime fields (`last_error_check`,
//    `last_start_time`, `last_error`, `session_id_poller`,
//    `retroactive_capture_excludes`) that disk reload zeroes by design.
// 3. `merge_runtime_fields` does NOT carry `status`, `last_accessed_at`,
//    `idle_entered_at`, or the `PriorTickTracking` fields
//    (`ever_confirmed_present`, `unknown_since`, `detection`).
//    Those are handled per StatusSource: DiskOnly takes prior.status,
//    `prior.idle_entered_at.or(fresh.idle_entered_at)`, and prior's
//    tracking verbatim (its `fresh` never went through
//    `update_status_with_metadata`, so those fields are still at their
//    zeroed defaults). TmuxApplied takes fresh's status and tracking:
//    the caller (`status_poll_loop`) already seeded `fresh` from the
//    prior tick's tracking before running the tmux scrape and status
//    decision, so `fresh` already holds this tick's authoritative values;
//    restoring the pre-decision prior snapshot here would erase that
//    decision every tick, re-freezing the Unknown->Error escalation window
//    at zero elapsed time (#2865) and dropping a detection awaiting its
//    confirming poll (#3642). `last_accessed_at` is monotonic-max
//    regardless.
// 4. The acp overlay filter is `inst.is_structured()`, never the lazy
//    ACP session id. The latter is set lazily by the ACP handshake
//    and is None for newly-spawned acp sessions; using it as the
//    filter would silently drop overlay coverage for pre-handshake
//    rows.
// 5. `prior_by_id` is built with `.drain(..)` once, then read with
//    `.get()` rather than `.remove()` in the merge loop, so the same map is
//    still populated when `apply_acp_overlay_inplace` runs.
// 6. Polling is canonical. The watcher path
//    adds latency reduction; correctness still holds when it fails.
// 7. `status_poll_loop` and `disk_watcher_consumer` may interleave
//    per-tick; both serialise on `state.instances.write().await`. A
//    DiskOnly merge between a TmuxApplied write and a subsequent tmux
//    scrape can briefly carry the prior status; it self-corrects on
//    the next 2s tick. Polling is canonical (invariant 6) so this is
//    acceptable.
// 8. Every caller must read `state.mutation_epoch` BEFORE its disk read and
//    pass that value as `read_epoch`. `fresh` is a snapshot of
//    `sessions.json`, so a committed membership or view transition that lands
//    between that read and this call makes the snapshot unsafe. A wholesale
//    replace could resurrect or drop a row, while a per-id merge could restore
//    the previous execution backend and make a subsequent enable or disable
//    take the wrong idempotent path. The comparison and every epoch bump happen
//    under the `state.instances` write lock, after the durable mutation lands.
//    This closes the check-then-act race while preserving externally created
//    rows when the epoch still matches.

/// Reload `state.instances` by merging caller-supplied `fresh` against the
/// prior in-memory snapshot per id, then reapplying the acp overlay.
/// The caller is responsible for the disk read and, on the
/// `TmuxApplied` path only, for emitting `state.status_tx`
/// diffs BEFORE invoking the helper.
/// Snapshot of the prior in-memory `state.instances` keyed by id, used
/// for per-id merging in `reload_state_instances_from_disk` and the
/// acp-overlay pass. Intentionally exposes only `drain_from` and `get`;
/// no `remove` method, because invariant 5 of the merge contract
/// requires the same map to be populated when
/// `apply_acp_overlay_inplace` runs after the merge loop. The compiler
/// rejects any future `.remove()` call instead of relying on prose.
